# CardanoPress - Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) Dashboard Plugin


The CardanoPress Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) Dashboard allows any project to run their own ISPO. The plugin comes
with a dashboard calculator layout and a delegation mechanism to allow wallets, that can connect to decentralised
application websites, to delegate directly to the ISPO stake pools within a few clicks.

These mechanisms and designed features were created to improve the user experience for anyone that is new to ISPOs and
want to ensure that they are delegating to the correct stake pools in a safe manner.

These layouts and user experiences have been inspired by other successful ISPOs in the Cardano ecosystem such as Genius
Yield and Flac Finance.

Our plugin does the heavy lifting allowing users to easily connect their wallets and interact with the ISPO dashboard.

We are supporting various wallets including:

* Nami
* Eternl
* Typhon
* GeroWallet
* Flint
* Yoroi (to a point)
* NuFi
* Cardwallet


This plugin requires the parent plugin [CardanoPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cardanopress/) and a free account
with [Blockfrost](http://bit.ly/3W90KDd) to be able to talk to the Cardano blockchain.

The plugin is created by the team at [PB Web Development](https://pbwebdev.com).

You can find out more information about CardanoPress and our blockchain integrations at [CardanoPress.io](https://cardanopress.io).

## Example Use Cases

One notable project that is using the ISPO plugin is GoKey.network, who have used it to allow users calculate how many
potential tokens they will earn in the ISPO by using their calculator.

They also use it to display the current stake pool delegation statistics and allow users to easily delegate to the ISPO
stake pool using the wallet connector within a few clicks.
